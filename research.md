# Research and Publications by Wyatt Makedonski
I try to advance the world by releasing knowledge completely open source in addition to my work. I enjoy research, learning, and sharing knowledge.

## “Dynamic Optimizing Virtual Power Plants”
*Makedonski, et al. (first author)*
* *November 2024*
* Paper introduces a new type of VPP that consists of dynamic DERs (such as EVs); 
proposes methods, algorithms, and AI models for the operation of this type of VPP 
for its realistic real world operation.

## “Tools and Methods for Measuring Virtual Power Plants and Distributed Energy Resources”
*Makedonski, et al. (first author)*
* *December 2024*
* Paper introduces tools and methods for measuring VPPs and DERs.

## “Intelligent Demand Response”
*Makedonski, et al. (first author)*
* *Under review*
* Paper introduces concepts and methods for intelligent and adaptive Demand Response 
control to improve real world operations and outcomes.
* Paper applies concepts from machine learning, reinforcement learning, and economics.

## “A Taxonomy of Virtual Power Plants and Their Dynamics”
*Makedonski, et al. (first author)*
* *Intended publication date: early 2025*
* Paper discusses different types of VPPs, proposes a classification schema, 
discusses the various dynamics of each classification.

## “Nodal Optimizing Virtual Power Plants”
*Makedonski, et al. (first author)*
* *Intended publication date: early 2025*
* Paper applies concepts from mathematical optimization, graph theory, reinforcement learning, and economics.

# Electricity Grid Architecture
How do we build the grid of the future, one that is 100% carbon free and distributed (meaning that it can support many EVs, batteries, solar panels, and flexible appliances)? Right now, this is an open problem. I propose a system that aims to solve this problem and provides a solution that works in the near term and scales to the distant future. The system is fairly simple yet robust. I have been working on this system since 2021.

## “Buildings are Computers”
*Makedonski, et al. (first author)*
* *Under review*
* On electricity grid architecture

## “The Grid as a Computer”
*Makedonski, et al. (first author)*
* *Under review*
* On electricity grid architecture

# Economics
While creating my Grid Architecture papers, I created an interesting concept that has broader implications in cooperative bargaining. Extending that, I have stumbled upon several concepts that may be more broadly applicable in the field. I am investigating the concepts further.
