## Mission
I have committed my life to improving the world. This is not a light commitment or something I am saying to virtue signal. I am committed to the energy field as that field is the single most important field in the battle against climate change (likely the biggest challenge facing humanity). I have founded multiple companies in energy (including my current company), have written multiple research papers to progress the field, and create educational content to attract more people to the field.

## Introduction
I have been working in energy since before I left college in 2016. I have been working in AI (specifically machine learning) since 2017. Working in energy led me to my work in AI as the technology is capable of solving many problems and creating a lot of value in the world. I apply AI to the energy field.

I have built two state of the art machine learning systems (meaning that they are the single best performing system in the world at their task) at both Gradient Energy and Yize NRG (both using deep reinforcement learning). I have built another production machine learning system with superhuman performance on its task (natural language processing) while at IEEE GlobalSpec. I have built another high-performing production machine learning system (computer vision) at HiroFit; there were no published benchmarks for state of the art or human performance (the task was not suited to be compared one-to-one to human performance) so I cannot make a claim that it exceeded their performance, but it was a pioneering system in the field with subjectively higher performance and more features than other systems, and, most importantly, it made our users very happy.

## Work History

### Cisco Systems
**Software Engineer Intern**, 2015, San Jose, California

We created an internal financial management and tracking application managing over $160M, 1,300 people annually. It was a web app using the MEAN stack (MySQL, Express, Angular.js, Node.js).

### John Deere
**Software Engineer Intern**, Summer 2014 & Summer 2013, Iowa

I created a warranty data system that connected warranty claims with specific production segments, departments, and locations in their tractor factories. Within months of release, it was being used in multiple factories located around the world. The software used Excel as the primary UI, streamed analytics to SAS, and integrated with the enterprise SAP database.
