# Wyatt Makedonski

## Mission
I have committed my life to improving the world. This is not a light commitment or something I am saying to virtue signal. I mean it. I am doing this through my work in the energy field as that field is the single most important field in the battle against climate change (likely the biggest challenge facing humanity). I have founded multiple companies in energy (including my current company), have written multiple research papers to progress the field, and create educational content to attract more people to the field.

## Introduction
I have been working in energy since 2016. I have been working in AI (specifically machine learning) since 2017. Working in energy led me to my work in AI as the technology is capable of solving many problems and creating a lot of value in the world. I apply AI to the energy field.

### AI
I have built two state of the art machine learning systems (meaning that they are the single best performing system in the world at their task) at both Gradient Energy and Yize NRG (both using deep reinforcement learning). I have built another production machine learning system with superhuman performance on its task (natural language processing) while at IEEE GlobalSpec. I have built another high-performing production machine learning system (computer vision) at HiroFit; there were no published benchmarks for state of the art or human performance (the task was not suited to be compared one-to-one to human performance) so I cannot make a claim that it exceeded their performance, but it was a pioneering system in the field with subjectively higher performance and more features than other systems, and, most importantly, it made our users very happy.

### I’ll Be Honest
I am not known for my lack of weakness, I have many weaknesses. I have a narrow set of strengths and skills that I try to apply to create value. I try my best to be aware of my gaps and avoid commenting and acting on matters in those areas; I prefer to defer to someone better at those areas. Even in areas where I am relatively strong, I still have much to learn and improve.

### Yize NRG
**Founder**, 2017-2019

Yize NRG ("wise energy") used AI to optimize the operations of HVAC (heating and cooling) systems for buildings for big savings and grid flexibility.

#### Impact
Optimizing HVAC systems seems pretty boring and esoteric. Are you wondering about the implications and impacts of it? Contact me, they're more than you think.

### Cisco Systems
**Software Engineer Intern**, 2015, San Jose, California

We created an internal financial management and tracking application managing over $160M, 1,300 people annually. It was a web app using the MEAN stack (MySQL, Express, Angular.js, Node.js).

### John Deere
**Software Engineer Intern**, Summer 2014 & Summer 2013, Iowa

I created a warranty data system that connected warranty claims with specific production segments, departments, and locations in their tractor factories. Within months of release, it was being used in multiple factories located around the world. The software used Excel as the primary UI, streamed analytics to SAS, and integrated with the enterprise SAP database.

## Research Topics
I try to advance the world by releasing knowledge completely open source in addition to my work. I enjoy research, learning, and sharing knowledge, but I do appropriately budget my time. Two papers are already written and are under review, one is a draft that is mostly complete, and the last is an active draft. I contribute to this when I have free time as my work is my focus.
